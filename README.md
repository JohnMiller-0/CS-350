# CS-350

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This is the final project of the class and is a Thermostat state machine (SM). The SM cycles between off, cool, and heat. The system has a red LED that blinks when heating to the set temp and is solid on when at or above the set temp. The blue LED blinks when cooling to the set temp and is solid on when at or below the set temp.

## What did you do particularly well?
The code is well-written using best practices and well commented.

## Where could you improve?
A fourth state, 'Auto', could be added wherein the machine cycles back and forth between heating and cooling to remain at a specific temperature.

## What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I am adding Ubuntu, a Linux-based distribution, to my network of skills. Learning the different commands, such as sudo, apt, and pip3 enabled me to download the necessary libraries to run the thermostat script on my Raspberry Pi.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Learning new coding patterns and structures, along with real-world applications, will help me complete my bachelor's degree.  

## How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I made this project readable, maintainable, and adaptable by writing well-structured and commented code.
